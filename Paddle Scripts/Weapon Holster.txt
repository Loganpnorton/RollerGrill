If you want to pick primary weapons/holster your weapon quickly on controller, you NEED to have paddles.

Use Steam controller configuration to bind your paddles to keyboard keys.

Example Bindings:
Paddle 1 = 1 Number Key
Paddle 2 = 2 Number Key
Paddle 3 = 3 Number Key

This will allow you to choose whether you want to pull out your primary or secondary, and also instantly holster weapons.
